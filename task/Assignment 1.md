WID3001 – Functional and Logic Programming Assignment 1 **Arithmetic Expression Evaluator** Work in teams of 3-4 students and submit one assignment per group by Week 7\. **Task Details:** 

The provided code is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) tool for evaluating arithmetic  expressions (e.g., "2 \+ 3 \* (4 \- 1)"). It was generated using an AI model and it includes  numerous flaws and bugs. The code is provided separately in a single file called Evaluator.hs (make sure to download the code along with this assignment file). Use Haskell GHC to  implement this assignment ➔ https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/. 

**Part 1: Debug & Refactor** 

Your first task is to debug and refactor this Haskell code for a simple arithmetic expression  evaluator.  

1\. Identify and fix at least eight (8) runtime errors or edge cases in the flawed code. 2\. Improve the code structure by organizing it into multiple logically separated modules. 3\. Refactor the code by applying functional programming principles discussed in our  lectures, implementing at least three (3) design improvements. 

**Part 2: Extend** 

Choose two (2) extensions from the list below and implement them. Make sure to integrate  the new features implementation in the fixed and refactored code. 

1\. Add support for exponentiation (^) with right-associativity.   
2\. Add support for the following basic functions: **sin**, **abs** and **sqrt**.   
3\. Allow variables (e.g., evaluate "x \+ 2" with a provided value for x via CLI flags). **Deliverables** 

• **Code**: A zip file containing the fixed and refactored Haskell code.   
• **Test Cases**: A separate file (e.g., Tests.hs) with at least 10 unit tests using HUnit library ➔ https://github.com/hspec/HUnit. Include tests for fixed bugs (edge cases) AND the new features. 

• **Short Explanation (PDF file)**: Describe your code improvements, such as:  o Bugs fixed and how. 

o Refactoring choices (following FP principles).   
o Screenshots of working tool: 3-5 screenshots showing the CLI in action,  including error handling and the new features. 

**AI Usage Policy:** You may use AI tools to search for information and brainstorm ideas.  However, this must be acknowledged in your report. AVOID direct copy/paste in the final  report as this will damage the final score.
